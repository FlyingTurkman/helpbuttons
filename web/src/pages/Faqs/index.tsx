        <Accordion title="What's Helpbuttons">
        <span className="highlight">Helpbuttons</span> is the <span className="highlight">open-source software</span> that powers this app. With Helpbuttons, you can create your own <span className="highlight">networks</span> for sharing <span className="highlight">food, housing, transportation</span>, or anything else you have in mind, and then federate with other networks to share users and resources. Helpbuttons specializes in connecting people who don't yet know each other, for various purposes, in the real world.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="What's for">
          We aim to foster a <span className="highlight">cohesive society</span>, promote <span className="highlight">cooperation</span>, and optimize the design of <span className="highlight">collaborative tools</span> in order to fully leverage the advantages of the internet. In brief, we've observed the substantial amounts of money, time, and user participation required each time a new collaborative app is launched. This seems unnecessary. Most of these tools share a significant portion of their core functionalities. We believe these commonalities could be managed using the same software, simply adapted for each unique purpose through various modules.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="What's a Helpbutton">
          A <span className="highlight">Helpbutton</span> refers to a <span className="highlight">post</span>. Every post published by a user in Helpbuttons is termed a helpbutton. Helpbuttons can represent <span className="highlight">offers, needs, exchanges, transport proposals, businesses</span>, and so forth. They can also be renamed to suit the specific needs of your app.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="What's a Network">
        A <span className="highlight">Network</span> refers to your individual instance of Helpbuttons. You can create your own network, designate a purpose (such as <span className="highlight">sharing food, helping animals, caring for elders</span>, etc.) and begin collaborating with any group you want (be it your neighborhood, sports club, village, course mates, etc.).            
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="The community">
          The <span className="highlight">Helpbuttons community</span> is the backbone of this project, providing it with sustainability. This tool is designed for adaptability to a multitude of purposes, thereby benefitting a diverse range of users while also encouraging support for the project. By federating with other Helpbuttons apps, you can share users and resources. This method of <span className="highlight">collaboration</span> enables us to unite more people and ultimately improve the tool we provide.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Ethics Policies">
