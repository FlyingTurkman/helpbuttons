This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

To avoid problems with package-lock.json.
Use 'npm ci' instead of 'npm install'. If your version of npm doesn't recognize it , use first:

npm install -g npm

Just use 'npm install' if you  modified the package.json locally.  

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
