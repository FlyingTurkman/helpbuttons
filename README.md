## Welcome to Helpbuttons Repo

This is the front repository for Helpbuttons. In order to communicate with the API you need to install [hb-back](https://github.com/helpbuttons/hb-back) too. For more detailed info check the hb-docs repo (https://github.com/helpbuttons/hb_docs).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

To avoid problems with package-lock.json.
Use 'npm ci' instead of 'npm install'. If your version of npm doesn't recognize it , use first:

npm install -g npm

Just use 'npm install' if you  modified the package.json locally.  

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
